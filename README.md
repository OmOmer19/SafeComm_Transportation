# SafeComm_Transportation 🚍

## Introduction
SafeComm is a community-based safety app aimed at improving public transportation. The platform tracks real-time locations of public transit vehicles, allows users to submit safety reports, and provides route safety ratings. It helps commuters make informed decisions based on real-time data and community feedback.

## Project Goal
The goal of SafeComm is to build a backend system that manages real-time tracking of public transportation, user interactions for safety ratings, and data storage for transit and user safety reports.

## Minimum Expected Features

### User Authentication
- JWT-based user registration and login system to authenticate users securely.

### Transit Tracking API
- API to track public transportation vehicles in real time, using data from third-party services such as Google Maps.

### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- Regular users can rate routes and view transit information.
- Admins can manage transit data and monitor safety reports.

### Third-Party Location Integration
- Integration with a location API (e.g., Google Maps) to provide live updates on vehicle locations.

### Route Safety Rating Service
- Users can rate the safety of public transit routes to help others make informed travel decisions.

### MongoDB Integration
- Store user profiles, transit data, route ratings, and reported safety issues in MongoDB.

## Technology Stack

- **Frontend:** React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Ant Design
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** MongoDB, Mongoose

- `GET /transit/live` – Live transit vehicle locations (user/admin)
- `GET /transit/arrival/:routeName` – Estimated arrival times (user/admin)
- `GET /transit/live-otd` – Live vehicle data (user/admin)

### Reports
- `POST /transit/reports` – Submit a safety report (user)
- `GET /transit/reports/user` – Get user-submitted reports (user)
- `GET /transit/reports` – Get all reports (admin)

### Ratings
- `POST /ratings` – Submit route rating (user/admin)
- `GET /ratings/:routeName` – Get average route rating (user/admin)
